## Problem 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

#create a data frame
basic_df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = random_sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "H", "W", "1", "done", "by", "QiLu"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("I", "I", "I", "II", "II", "II", "III", "III") )
  
)

pull(basic_df, random_sample)
pull(basic_df, vec_logical)
pull(basic_df, vec_factor)

mean(as.numeric(pull(basic_df,vec_logical)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(basic_df,vec_char)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(basic_df,vec_factor)))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
